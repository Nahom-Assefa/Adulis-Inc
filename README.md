## Background

Adulis was birthed from TradeFast, physical kiosks serving in the lower Twin Cities metro from late 2017 to mid 2019. Due to the business pain points of being a location that customers had to physically go to the seeds were planted to create a web-application that would route appointments to Adulis contractors on a job board to enable them to meet customers at their designated choice of meet-up. The pitch was, "a certified business that would ensure a safe, transparent, and worthwhile means to transact value in the chaotic and messy world of peer-peer used electronics exchange."

## Installation

Firstly install the NoSql database mongoDB on to your machine. <br> 
Windows guide: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community <br>
Mac guide: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

Use "npm install" to install required modules for this application. Two notable packages for this project were mongoose as the document object mapper, and express.js for serving CRUD operations. In server.js file mongoose.connect will look for a database if it does not exist or create one for you. You're welcome to change the local MongoDB's server short-circuit as you see fit.

## Usage

Adulis is a web-app that allows one to sell electronic devices in various physical conditions for cash or cash-like equivalents. 

Navigate through the tabs to learn more about how it works. Visit the sell tab and go through the prompts to see a payout estimate for a particular device.

## Contributions

This project was built by me with some contributions from Dino Aganovic a freelance designer on upwork, and Mistre Mulugeta a graphic designer that was on staff at Adulis with UI experience. As well as general business directives from CEO Aaron Mekonnen. While completing my full-stack certification at the University Of Minnesota I took this project on -which was static in nature- to include a backend and server-side components to highlight my skillset in this area.
